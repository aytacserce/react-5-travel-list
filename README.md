This is a packing list project built with React with following functionality and key concepts:
- We can;
  - Add items to the packing list by selecting a quantity and entering a description,
  - Select items as "packed" using related checkbox to mark them as complete by strike-through text,
  - Delete items completely from the list using X (delete) button next to them,
  - Sort items by their input order, alphabetically and by their packed status',
  - Clear all list using "Clear List" button after a confirmation,
  - Chect stats on footer like "number of items", how many of them were packed and packed percentage (all this dinamically).
- In this project; props, state, lifting the state up, derived state, handling forms and submittion, controlled elements and sorting items were practiced.
